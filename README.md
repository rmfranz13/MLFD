# MLFD
I am interested in making a self-improving, self-optimizing, chess-playing algorithm from scratch in python/c. I'm a freelance programmer and spend most of my time making cool physics programs for other people, so I just wanted to do something for myself, plus I need something to focus my intense procrastination-driven work loads on. I'm also amazed at what the open-source community is capable of accomplishing and want to be a part of it however I can. I'm not experienced enough to help with most open-source projects I admire, so I'm starting my own. MLFD stands for "Machine Learning For Dummies", since I'm a dummy in the field of machine learning.

## Algorithmic State Machines
Even though this project will be implemented in pyhon and/or c, I plan on sticking to a very modular ASM-like structure. For my own personal understanding, I plan on including a README in every director and, if applicable, a flow chart describing the flow of data and overall methodology. As the code changes and new algorithms are implemented, so should the README and flow chart change to match that. Below is a very general outline that can help start to break this project into smaller parts.
