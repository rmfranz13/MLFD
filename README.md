# MLFD
I am interested in making a self-improving, self-optimizing, chess-playing algorithm from scratch in python/c. So far I have created 2 flowcharts and a single python script, so obviously there's a little ways to go here. MLFD stands for "Machine Learning For Dummies", since I'm a dummy and I'm doing machine learning.

## Algorithmic State Machines (ASM)
Even though this project will be implemented in python and/or c, I plan on sticking to a very modular ASM-like structure. For my own personal understanding, I plan on including a README in every directory and, if applicable, a flow chart describing the flow of and manipulation of data as it is operated on by the main program of that directory (if one exists). As the code changes and new algorithms are implemented, so the README and flow chart should change to match it. As this is a learning experience for me, my top priority in the beginning is understanding, and thus I will not accept good optimizations if they lead to confusing code.

## ASM-like flow-chart for how I'm imagining the final product will operate
