# MLFD
I am interested in making a self-improving, self-optimizing, chess-playing algorithm from scratch in python/c. I'm a freelance programmer and spend most of my time making cool physics programs for other people, so I just wanted to do something for myself. Also I take procrastination very seriously and I'm hoping this project will satisfy my need. 

I'm amazed at what the open-source community is capable of accomplishing and want to take part. I'm not experienced enough to help with most open-source projects I admire, so I'm starting my own. MLFD stands for "Machine Learning For Dummies", since I'm a dummy in the field of machine learning.

## Algorithmic State Machines (ASM)
Even though this project will be implemented in python and/or c, I plan on sticking to a very modular ASM-like structure. For my own personal understanding, I plan on including a README in every directory and, if applicable, a flow chart describing the flow of and manipulation of data as it is operated on by the main program of that directory (if one exists). As the code changes and new algorithms are implemented, so the README and flow chart should change to match it. As this is a learning experience for me, my top priority in the beginning is understanding, and thus I will not accept good optimizations if they lead to confusing code.
