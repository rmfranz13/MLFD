# MLFD
I am interested in making a self-improving, self-optimizing, chess-playing algorithm from scratch in python/c. I'm a freelance programmer and spend most of my time making cool physics programs for other people, so I just wanted to do something for myself, plus I need something to focus my intense procrastination-driven work loads on. I'm also amazed at what the open-source community is capable of accomplishing and want to be a part of it however I can. I'm not experienced enough to help with most open-source projects I admire, so I'm starting my own.
